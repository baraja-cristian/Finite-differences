# Finite differences program in python
## Finite differences is a numerical method used to approximate the solutions of differential equations by discretizing the derivatives. In this approach, the continuous derivatives in a differential equation are replaced with finite difference approximations.
# Installation
Create a virtual environment in python
```sh
python3 -m venv env
```
Install the file requirements.txt
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
